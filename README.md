# New-Siri-Voices
New voices for Siri. Before adding a language, please check Siri doesn't already support that language accent or that we don't already have that language/accent in this repository. We also would like to stick to national dialects as opposed to regional/local dialects or ethnic/cultural dialects. Male and female voices are allowed.

To create a file, download a text to speech .mp3 file of the language you want. It should not sound highly robotic. When you upload it, put the file in a folder. The folder's name should be the native name of the language. The files name should be the English name of the language/accent. For example, an accent would be French (France) not Français (France) but the folder would be Français not French. If you are uploading an accent, put it in a folder named whatever the language's native name is (e.g if uploading French (France) don't name the folder Français (France), name it Français). The file name must also specify:
* The accent (for languages spoken in various, e.g English but not ones spoken in only one or a few countries, e.g Bulgarian)
* The gender (e.g French (France) (male) for a male French voice in a France accent)
Thanks!
