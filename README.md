# New-Siri-Voices
New English accents for Siri. Before adding an accent, please check Siri doesn't already support that accent or that we don't already have that language/accent in this repository. We also would like to stick to national dialects as opposed to regional/local dialects (Scottish and Welsh voices are allowed) or ethnic/cultural dialects. Male and female voices are allowed. Siri already has 6 different English accents, all of which are available in both male and female voice; American, Australian, English (labeled as British), Indian, Irish and South African. 

To create a file, download a text to speech .mp3 file of the language you want. It should not sound highly robotic. When you upload it, put the file in a folder. The folder's name should be the native name of the dialect. The file's name should be the name of the language/accent. For example, an accent would be English (England). The accent should also come from a country where English is spoken as an official language/lingua franca (e.g don't put English (Mainland China) because English is not spoken much at all in Mainland China let alone being an official language). The file name must also specify:
* The accent (for languages spoken in various, e.g English but not ones spoken in only one or a few countries, e.g Bulgarian)
* The gender (e.g English (England) (male) for a male English voice in an English accent)
Thanks!
